        Chief Conductor of the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra Karina Canellakis makes her San Francisco
        Symphony debut in a presentation of music by twoRussian heavyweights: Prokofiev’s ravishingly colorful and
        percussive Piano Concerto No. 1, played by the Ukranian piano powerhouse Alexander Gavrylyuk (who also makes
        his SF Symphony debut at these concerts),and Shostakovich’s defiant 1941 bombshell, the Leningrad
        Symphony.</p> <p class="body-text3">In the twilight of Imperial Russia, a brazen 21-year-old pianist submitted his own
        concerto as a graduation piece. A sassy and whimsical fantasy written for a formidable soloist (himself), the
        1912 Piano Concerto No. 1 by Prokofiev scandalized the old guard. Less than thirty years later, Shostakovich
        unveiled his Seventh Symphony, but Russia was a different place. The old guard was all but extinguished;
        Stalin had prosecuted his Great Terror, and Hitler held Leningrad under siege.
